# Signal Processing Web App

A web-based tool for generating, visualizing, and analyzing signals with filtering, FFT, and control systems simulation. Includes an AI tutor for learning signal processing concepts.

## Features
- Generate signals (sine, square, triangle, noise).
- Visualize time and frequency domains.
- Apply filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass).
- Simulate control systems (Bode, root locus).
- AI tutor for answering signal processing questions.
